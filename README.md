# Global, with universal-ctags

This tap is fork and maintained here because homebrew-core doesn't allow `option` for now.


## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install taiansu/global/global`


## Contribution

I'll try to keep the global version up to date. But PRs are more then welcome.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
